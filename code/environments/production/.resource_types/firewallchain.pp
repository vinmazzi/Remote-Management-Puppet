# This type provides the capability to manage rule chains for firewalls.
# 
# Currently this supports only iptables, ip6tables and ebtables on Linux. And
# provides support for setting the default policy on chains and tables that
# allow it.
# 
# **Autorequires:**
# If Puppet is managing the iptables, iptables-persistent, or iptables-services packages,
# and the provider is iptables_chain, the firewall resource will autorequire
# those packages to ensure that any required binaries are installed.

    # This is the action to when the end of the chain is reached.
    # It can only be set on inbuilt chains (INPUT, FORWARD, OUTPUT,
    # PREROUTING, POSTROUTING) and can be one of:
    # 
    # * accept - the packet is accepted
    # * drop - the packet is dropped
    # * queue - the packet is passed userspace
    # * return - the packet is returned to calling (jump) queue

    # To support flags, use the ruby inline flag mechanism.
    # Meaning a regex such as

    #   '(?i)foo' or '(?i:foo)'

    # firewallchain { 'INPUT:filter:IPv4':
    #   purge => true,
    #   ignore => [
    #     '-j fail2ban-ssh', # ignore the fail2ban jump rule

    # 
    # iptables_chain
    # : Iptables chain provider

    #   * Required binaries: `ebtables-save`, `ebtables`, `ip6tables-save`, `ip6tables`, `iptables-save`, `iptables`.
