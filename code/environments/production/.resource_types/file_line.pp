# This file was automatically generated on 2017-09-14 02:10:03 -0400.
# Use the 'puppet generate types' command to regenerate this file.

# Ensures that a given line is contained within a file.  The implementation
# matches the full line, including whitespace at the beginning and end.  If
# the line is not contained in the given file, Puppet will append the line to
# the end of the file to ensure the desired state.  Multiple resources may
# be declared to manage multiple lines in the same file.
# 
# Example:
# 
#     file_line { 'sudo_rule':
#       path => '/etc/sudoers',
#       line => '%sudo ALL=(ALL) ALL',
#     }
# 
#     file_line { 'sudo_rule_nopw':
#       path => '/etc/sudoers',
#       line => '%sudonopw ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL',
#     }
# 
# In this example, Puppet will ensure both of the specified lines are
# contained in the file /etc/sudoers.
# 
# Match Example:
# 
#     file_line { 'bashrc_proxy':
#       ensure => present,
#       path   => '/etc/bashrc',
#       line   => 'export HTTP_PROXY=http://squid.puppetlabs.vm:3128',
#       match  => '^export HTTP_PROXY=',
#     }
# 
# In this code example match will look for a line beginning with export
# followed by HTTP_PROXY and replace it with the value in line.
# 
# Match Example With `ensure => absent`:
# 
#     file_line { 'bashrc_proxy':
#       ensure            => absent,
#       path              => '/etc/bashrc',
#       line              => 'export HTTP_PROXY=http://squid.puppetlabs.vm:3128',
#       match             => '^export HTTP_PROXY=',
#       match_for_absence => true,
#     }
# 
# In this code example match will look for a line beginning with export
# followed by HTTP_PROXY and delete it.  If multiple lines match, an
# error will be raised unless the `multiple => true` parameter is set.
# 
# Encoding example:
# 
#     file_line { "XScreenSaver":
#       ensure   => present,
#       path     => '/root/XScreenSaver'
#       line     => "*lock: 10:00:00",
#       match    => '^*lock:',
#       encoding => "iso-8859-1",
#     }
# 
# Files with special characters that are not valid UTF-8 will give the
# error message "invalid byte sequence in UTF-8".  In this case, determine
# the correct file encoding and specify the correct encoding using the
# encoding attribute, the value of which needs to be a valid Ruby character
# encoding.
# 
# **Autorequires:** If Puppet is managing the file that will contain the line
# being managed, the file_line resource will autorequire that file.
