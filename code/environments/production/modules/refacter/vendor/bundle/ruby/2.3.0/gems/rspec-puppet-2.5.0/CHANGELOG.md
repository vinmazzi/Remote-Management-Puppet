# Change Log
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file. This
project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/).

## [2.5.0]

Headline features are app management, nested hashes in params, and testing for "internal" functions.

Thanks to everyone who contributed: Leo Arnold, Matt Schuchard, and Si Wilkins

### Changed

* Updates to the README
* Improve Gemfile to work with older rubies

### Added

* Add support for app management testing
* Enable nested hashes in params
* After refactoring the function test code, puppet 4 "internal" functions can now be tested too
* Link functions and types on setup
* Increased test coverage

## [2.4.0]

This release now supports testing exported resources in the same way that normal resources in the catalog are tested. Access them in your examples using `exported_resources`. See "Testing Exported Resources" in the README for examples.

### Changed

* This release pulls out much of the version-specific code into separate classes to reduce complexity and enable easier maintenance going forward.

### Added

* Support colon-separated module_path and environmentpath values.
* Support a threshold for the code coverage test, that can fail the whole run.
* Ensure a consistent environment for all examples by adding a forced initialization of puppet before each.

### Credits

Thanks to Adrien Thebo, Arthur Gautier, Brett Gray, and Nicholas Hinds, as well as all the folks helping out on github for their contributions to this release.


## [2.3.2]

Properly fix yesterday's issue by unsharing the cache key before passing the data to puppet. This also contains a new test matrix to avoid missing a half-baked fix like yesterday.

## [2.3.1]

A quick workaround to re-enable testing with the recently released puppet 3.8.5 and the soon to be released puppet 4.3.2. See PUP-5743 for the gritty details. Upgrade to this version if you hit the "undefined method \`resource' for nil:NilClass" error.

## [2.3.0]

Rspec-puppet now supports testing custom types, `:undef` values in params, structured facts, and checks resource dependencies recursively.

The settings in `module_path` and `manifest` are now respected throughout the code base. The former default for `module_path` (`'/etc/puppet/modules'`) was dropped to avoid accidentally poisoning the test environment with unrelated code.

To reduce the maintenance overhead of boilerplate code, rspec-puppet now provides some of the code that rspec-puppet-init deployed in helper files that you can just `require` instead.

This release also reduces memory usage on bigger testsuites drastically by reducing the caching of compiled catalogs.

### Changed
- Limit the catalogue cache to 16 entries. Significant memory savings and reduced runtime were observed in testing this.
- Prevent Puppet 3's \_timestamp fact from invalidating cache.
- Extracted catalog cache from RSpec::Puppet::Support.
- Updated README to use the rspec 3 syntax, and additional explanations.
- `contain_file(...).with_content(...)` will now only show the diff and not the full contents of the file.

### Added
- Custom type testing example group and matcher.
- before/require/subscribe/notify checking now searches recursively through all dependencies. `File[a] -> File[b] -> File[c]` is now matched by `contain_file('a').that_comes_before('File[c]')`, whereas earlier versions would have missed that.
- `let(:params)` now allows `:undef` to pass a literal undef value through to the subject.
- Support structured facts with keys as symbols or strings (\#295).
- rspec-puppet-init now creates smaller files, using rspec-puppet helpers, instead of pasting code into the module.
- Added a list of related projects to the README.

### Fixed
- Fix #276: `compile.and_raise_error` now correctly considers successful compilation an error
- Puppet's `modulepath` can now contain multiple entries and rspec-puppet will configure puppet to load code from all of them
- Support running with rspec 2.99 again
- non-class resources are now covered by the coverage code
- Fix #323/MODULES-2374: autorequires checking doesn't abort on "undefined method \`[]' for nil:NilClass"
- improved documentation for hiera integration, added example spec
- document the `scope` property
